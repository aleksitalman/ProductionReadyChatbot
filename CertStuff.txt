We have used a self signed certificate that expires in 365 days.

The command used to get the cert with openssl:

'openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes'

For the server, required changes were to add the certfile and the keyfile locations to the Uvicorn setup files.

For the frontend, required changes were to change the url to the new https server.
